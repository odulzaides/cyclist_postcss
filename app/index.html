    </h2>

    <p>Our Purpose: Camaraderie and friendship are a main goal while at the same time providing excellent exercise and less
      use of our cars. We provide good bicycle rides starting in the Oak View/Ojai area with no need for a car to reach the
      starting point. [In the hot summer days we may start and complete the ride near the cool ocean!] </p>

    <p>To Join US: If you can ride 25 miles at an average pace of about 13 mph or higher, you can probably ride comfortably
      with us. For slower riders, see the
      <a href="#">"Rear Brigade"</a> page. Our normal starting points are from Oak View and Ojai. These are shown on the map on this
      link. In the summertime when it is hot in Ojai we go cycling near the ocean from different starting points. If you
      wish to receive more information or to be on our E-mail list, please get in touch with the webmaster on this link.
      All rides are described on this page in detail. If you have any questions or concerns please send your questions to
      this email address. On the regular rides we take three short rest stops on the ride: one by Lake Casitas, another in
      Foster Park and the last at Camp Comfort. All stops have a bathroom and drinking water. This road route combines uphill,
      downhill and flat roads to provide excellent exercise and beautiful scenery. At each of the three rest stops the lead
      riders of each group usually wait for the slower riders of the group to arrive before continuing the ride.</p>

      <h3>Rules of the Road</h3>

      <p>
        The chance of a crash increases in a group ride. This is especially true if riders are inexperienced and are not familiar
        with established “Rules of the Road”.

      </p>

      <p>
        We have come up with some "rules of the road”. While one might choose to take risks when riding alone, we would ask that
        our rules be followed when riding in our group.

      </p>
      <p>
        These are both safety and courtesy guidelines we would appreciate you following when riding in our group.

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Helmets are required, rear view mirrors are suggested (we like the mirror by Bike Peddler, Take-A-Look Mirror. It
          can be purchased here. Make sure to select "Original" size.)</li>

        <li> Be on time, we start at the designated time.</li>

        <li> If you see or hear a vehicle approaching, announce “car back” to the others.</li>

        <li> On the bike path announce approaching riders with “Rider up”.</li>

        <li> We all like to converse while riding, but when a vehicle approaches from the rear riders will form a single file.</li>

        <li> When there are riders close behind you point out road hazards such as debris, pot holes, parked cars with people
          who may exit or tree or brush branches.</li>

        <li> We will wait for approximately 5-10 minutes at each rest stop for slower riders to catch up. An exception to this
          will be made when the "Rear Brigade" has three or more riders in which case the front group may proceed at their
          own pace.</li>

        <li> Carry a cell phone with the phone numbers of the other riders. If you have a mechanical problem call one of the other
          riders in the group. We will come back to assist you.</li>

        <li> Carry enough equipment to repair a flat tire. If you want help with a flat just ask.</li>

        <li> Slow down when approaching intersections. If there is traffic in the intersection and you will have to stop, signal
          to the riders behind you with a flat open hand extended down and back. When an intersection is clear to proceed
          move forward and announce to those behind you “clear”.</li>

        <li> Signal turns by pointing to the left or right before making the turn.</li>

        <li> Pass other riders on the left. Look behind you before passing for bikes who may be attempting to pass you or approaching
          vehicles.
        </li>

        <li> When approaching other riders or walkers on the bike path, announce your approach with “on your left” then pass on
          the left.</li>

        <li> When you need to blow your nose, cough or spit, be considerate of those beside and behind you. Move to the leeward
          side of the pack or, better yet, to the back of the group before blowing your nose, coughing or spitting. Remember,
          when riding 15 to 25 mph everything you eject goes backwards quickly enough and far enough to land on fellow riders
          a considerable distance behind you.</li>

          The following are the links to the hourly weather reports from the weather channel (for Ojai and Ventura.) In general we
          will start from Ojai unless the hourly weather report in Ojai shows the "TEMP" or the "FEELS" going over 90º F
          between 9AM and noon.

      <h2>Our Rides</h2>
      <p>
        The main starting point for all these rides is at Vons parking lot in Ojai at 9:30 AM*. A map showing this location is
        <a href="http://ojaicyclists.fpemad.com/maps/Ojai%20%20---%20%20Oak%20View.gif">on this link</a>. If there is any change to the ride schedule below, all members of the group will be notified by
        Email. To get on the email list, or if you have any questions, please contact the Ojai Cyclists. A map and other
        interesting data about these rides is shown below after each ride (when available.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All rides have a sweeper who rides in the rear. The sweeper is considered the leader of the ride and helps (as needed) with
        problems which may develop on the ride --such as flats. Also, the ride leader may decide to change the ride route
        due to such reasons as road construction or simply to go on a different route.
      </p>

      <h3>Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday rides:</h3>
      <p>
        ride #1. The "usual" 23 mile ride. Sweeper is Ron, Charley or Roger. (
        <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/97505141">See Garmin map and data</a>)
      </p>
      <p>

        ride #2. A slow ride on mostly flat and very scenic terrain around Ojai. 15.5 , 23 and 32 miles. You can choose your distance
        as we go. Sweeper is either Charlie or Fawzi. (See
        <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/228619952">Garmin map and data</a>)

      </p>
      <h3>Special rides:</h3>
      <p>
        Special ride #1. Sometimes the sweeper (also considered the ride leader) may decide to change the ride as needed on special
        occasions. This special ride #1 avoids route 33 and Creek Road on the way back. It is 33.6 miles long and you can
        see a "Garmin map and data" by going to this
        <a target="_blank" href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/186029751">link</a>.
      </p>
      <p>

        Special ride #2. This ride also avoids a return on route 33 and Creek road, total distance about 27 miles. Its Garmin Data
        and map are
        <a target="_blank" href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/187722358">here</a>.
